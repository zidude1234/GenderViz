## Capstone Overview
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in the Nigeria is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.

## Case Study Questions
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company‚Äôs salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
    - Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
    - Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 ‚Äì $20,000, $20,000 ‚Äì $30,000 etc. Also visualize this
by regions.
5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed another data to you that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to 
    - calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual .
    - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus).
    - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.
